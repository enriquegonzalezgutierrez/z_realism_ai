    "about_subtitle": "OUR MISSION",
    "about_desc_1": "Z-Realism is a professional-grade production studio engineered to transform your 2D character designs, concepts, and illustrations into coherent, high-fidelity photorealistic visuals. Our platform is at the forefront of generative AI, exploring the intersection between advanced diffusion models and artistic intent.",
    "about_desc_2": "We specialize in solving the 'Stylization-to-Realism Gap'—a common challenge where artistic designs lose their unique identity, anatomical coherence, or original color palette when translated into photorealistic forms. Z-Realism introduces precise control mechanisms designed to preserve these critical elements throughout the generative process.",
    
    "about_tech_h2": "Our Technology",
    "about_tech_p1": "Our core technology is built on the principle that photorealism is achieved not through brute-force model power, but through intelligent, precise control. Our methodology relies on surgically guiding the generative AI, treating the diffusion process not as a black box, but as a steerable tool for creative professionals.",
    "about_tech_p2": "By utilizing advanced conditioning layers via Dual ControlNet (Depth + Canny Edge), our system anchors the foundational geometry and structural intent of your design before seamlessly injecting high-resolution, cinematic textures. This layered approach ensures that your original artwork's structure is maintained, dramatically reducing distortion artifacts.",
    "about_tech_p3": "This allows us to generate stunning photorealistic results without sacrificing the core essence of your Original Artwork's DNA—the unique visual traits that define your creation across style, resolution, and context.",

    "tech_subtitle": "SYSTEM DESIGN & DDD",
    "tech_p1": "Z-Realism v1.0 is architected using the Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) pattern as a core design principle. This choice establishes a strict separation between the central business logic and all external dependencies, guaranteeing a system that is robust, scalable, and adaptable to evolving technological landscapes.",
    "tech_p2": "This decoupling ensures that our core value proposition—the high-fidelity synthesis, transformation, and evaluation of your original artwork's visual DNA—remains fully independent of volatile infrastructure components. As a result, technological upgrades can occur seamlessly, without disrupting your creative workflow.",
    
    "tech_h2_hex": "Hexagonal Implementation",
    "tech_hex_p1": "Our Hexagonal implementation is enforced by defining clear Ports (Interfaces) within the Domain Layer. These ports articulate the system’s capabilities in purely business terms, avoiding any coupling to specific hardware or software mechanics.",
    "tech_hex_p2": "Infrastructure adapters implement these ports and are injected at runtime, allowing the system to dynamically adapt to different computing environments. This enables us to maintain consistent output quality whether deployed on high-end servers or optimized for accessible local hardware.",
    "tech_hex_p3": "This design strictly adheres to the Liskov Substitution Principle (SOLID), guaranteeing that all adapters remain behaviorally consistent with the expectations of the core domain.",
    
    "tech_h2_gpu": "Hardware Orchestration",
    "tech_gpu_p1": "A critical advantage of Z-Realism is its optimization for demanding neural workloads on accessible, consumer-grade hardware. Our architecture is explicitly designed to maximize performance under constrained VRAM conditions while maintaining uncompromised output quality.",
    "tech_gpu_p2": "The Z-Realism Engine implements an intelligent Hardware Tenancy Protocol via a distributed, Redis-based Mutex. This protocol treats GPU access as a single, exclusive resource, preventing concurrent inference requests that would lead to system instability.",
    
    "tech_h4_res": "Resource Management Principles:",
    "tech_res_li1_t": "Exclusive GPU Access:",
    "tech_res_li1_d": "Guarantees that only one generative task runs on the GPU at any given time to ensure stable, high-quality output.",

    "tech_async_p1": "The lifecycle of a visual transformation within Z-Realism is designed for efficiency and responsiveness. Given the computational intensity, all long-running operations are decoupled from the immediate user interaction.",
    "tech_async_p2": "The system utilizes Celery as its task orchestrator and Redis as the message broker, forming a resilient production backbone. This architecture ensures the client application remains responsive while the backend performs intensive GPU workloads.",
    "tech_async_p3": "Real-time progress updates are streamed back through the broker, allowing clients to monitor and evaluate the production process in near real time.",
