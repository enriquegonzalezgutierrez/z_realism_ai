    "about_subtitle": "OUR MISSION",
    "about_desc_1": "Z-Realism is a professional-grade production studio designed to transform your 2D character designs, concepts, and illustrations into coherent, high-fidelity photorealistic visuals. Our platform operates at the forefront of generative AI, exploring the intersection between advanced diffusion models and artistic intent.",
    "about_desc_2": "We specialize in solving the 'Stylization-to-Realism Gap,' a common challenge where artistic designs lose their unique identity, anatomical coherence, or original color palette when translated into photorealistic forms. Z-Realism introduces precise control mechanisms designed to preserve these critical elements throughout the generative process.",

    "about_tech_h2": "Our Technology",
    "about_tech_p1": "Our core technology is built on the principle that photorealism is achieved not through brute model power, but through intelligent and precise control. Our methodology focuses on surgically guiding generative AI, treating the diffusion process not as a black box, but as a directed tool for creative professionals.",
    "about_tech_p2": "By leveraging advanced conditioning layers through Dual ControlNet (Depth + Canny Edges), our system anchors the fundamental geometry and structural intent of your design before seamlessly injecting high-resolution cinematic textures. This layered approach ensures that your original artwork’s structure is maintained, drastically reducing distortion artifacts.",
    "about_tech_p3": "This enables us to generate stunning photorealistic results without sacrificing the core essence of your artwork’s DNA: the unique visual traits that define your creation across style, resolution, and context.",

    "about_adv_h4": "Key Product Advantages:",
    "about_adv_1_t": "Identity Preservation:",
    "about_adv_1_d": "Our unique hybrid anchoring logic actively mitigates chromatic drift, facial distortion, and identity loss, ensuring your characters remain instantly recognizable.",

    "tech_subtitle": "SYSTEM DESIGN & DDD",
    "tech_p1": "Z-Realism v1.0 is structured using the Hexagonal Architecture pattern (Ports and Adapters) as its core design principle. This choice establishes a strict separation between core business logic and all external dependencies, ensuring a robust, scalable, and adaptable system in evolving technological landscapes.",
    "tech_p2": "This decoupling ensures que our core value proposition — the high-fidelity synthesis, transformation, and evaluation of your artwork’s visual DNA — remains fully independent of volatile infrastructure components. As a result, technological upgrades can occur without disrupting your creative workflow.",

    "tech_h2_hex": "Hexagonal Implementation",
    "tech_hex_p1": "Our hexagonal implementation defines clear Ports (Interfaces) within the Domain Layer. These ports articulate system capabilities in purely business terms, avoiding any coupling with specific hardware or software mechanics.",
    "tech_hex_p2": "Infrastructure adapters implement these ports and are injected at runtime, enabling the system to dynamically adapt to different computing environments. This allows us to maintain consistent output quality whether deployed on high-end servers or optimized for accessible local hardware.",
    "tech_hex_p3": "This design strictly adheres to the Liskov Substitution Principle (SOLID), ensuring that all adapters remain consistent with core domain expectations.",

    "tech_h2_gpu": "Hardware Orchestration",
    "tech_gpu_p1": "A critical advantage of Z-Realism is its optimization for demanding neural workloads on accessible consumer hardware. Our architecture is explicitly designed to maximize performance under constrained VRAM conditions while maintaining uncompromised output quality.",
    "tech_gpu_p2": "The Z-Realism engine implements an intelligent Hardware Tenancy protocol via a Redis-based distributed Mutex. This protocol treats GPU access as a unique, exclusive resource, preventing concurrent inference requests.",

    "tech_h4_res": "Resource Management Principles:",
    "tech_res_li1_t": "Exclusive GPU Access:",
    "tech_res_li1_d": "Ensures that only one generative task runs on the GPU at any given time to guarantee stable, high-quality output.",
    "tech_res_li2_t": "Aggressive Memory Management:",
    "tech_res_li2_d": "Our worker dynamically purges VRAM allocations and invokes garbage collection during model transitions.",
    "tech_res_li3_t": "Layered Weight Streaming:",
    "tech_res_li3_d": "Large neural model components are dynamically streamed between system RAM and GPU VRAM during active computation.",

    "tech_h2_async": "Asynchronous Production Pipeline",
    "tech_async_p1": "The lifecycle of a visual transformation within Z-Realism is designed for efficiency and responsiveness. Given the computational intensity, all long-running operations are decoupled from immediate user interaction.",
    "tech_async_p2": "The system uses Celery as a task orchestrator and Redis as a message broker, forming a resilient production network. This architecture ensures that the client application remains responsive while the backend performs intensive GPU workloads.",
    "tech_async_p3": "Real-time progress updates are streamed back through the broker, allowing clients to monitor and evaluate the production process almost in real time.",
