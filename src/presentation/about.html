                    Z-Realism AI is a professional-grade research ecosystem engineered for the 
                    photorealistic synthesis of 2D character manifolds. Our primary scientific 
                    objective is to solve the <strong>Structural and Chromatic Drift Problems</strong>—a 
                    prevalent challenge in neural style transfer where the geometric identity 
                    and color integrity of the source are often compromised during 
                    high-entropy denoising pipelines.

            <h2>The Scientific Thesis</h2>
            <p>
                Our methodology relies on the surgical control of the stochastic denoising 
                process. By utilizing hierarchical conditioning via <strong>Dual ControlNet 
                (Depth + OpenPose)</strong>, the system anchors the underlying geometry 
                before injecting high-resolution cinematic textures. This approach allows 
                for the generation of photorealistic results without sacrificing the core 
                essence of the original <strong>Subject DNA</strong>.

                <h4>Core Research Pillars:</h4>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li><strong>Original Fidelity Protocol:</strong> A hybrid prompt-anchoring logic that mitigates chromatic saturation loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporal Consistency:</strong> Stable Video Diffusion protocols adapted for high-resolution output on limited hardware.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heuristic Metadata:</strong> An intelligence layer that sequences visual DNA into optimal latent parameters.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Hardware Orchestration</h2>
            <p>
                A critical contribution of this project is the optimization of high-latency 
                neural workloads for consumer-grade hardware. The <strong>Z-Realism v21.1 Engine</strong> 
                implements an aggressive VRAM resource manager and <strong>Sequential CPU-VRAM 
                Offloading</strong>. This allows for the synthesis of 1024px video frames on 
                NVIDIA GPUs with only 6GB of VRAM, effectively utilizing system RAM as a massive 
                latent buffer.

            <h2>Authorship & Clean Code</h2>
            <p>
                The Z-Realism project is conceptualized and developed by <strong>Enrique González Gutiérrez</strong> 
                as part of a doctoral thesis in Informatics Engineering. The ecosystem is 
                architected under <strong>SOLID principles</strong> and <strong>Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</strong>, 
                ensuring that the neural engine remains modular, testable, and resilient to 
                technological shifts in the generative AI landscape.
