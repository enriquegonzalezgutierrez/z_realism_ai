            <p>
                Z-Realism is committed to protecting your privacy. Our service is designed around 
                the principle of local data sovereignty. All inference workflows are executed 
                within a secure, isolated environment, and **no user-uploaded content or 
                generated outputs are stored on our servers, transmitted to external services, 
                or shared with third parties.**
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform utilizes essential session tokens (cookies) to manage your active 
                session and relate your client interface with ongoing **AI Production Tasks**. 
                This is a technical requirement for service continuity. 
                **No personal data, behavioral analytics, or identifying metadata is collected, 
                stored, or transmitted by Z-Realism for any purpose beyond service delivery.**
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not employ any third-party tracking mechanisms, advertising identifiers, 
                or data profiling tools. Your creative process and data remain entirely private.

                    in memory to generate the output. Once the generation is complete and the 
                    result is delivered to your browser, all related temporary data is immediately 
                    discarded from our systems. We do not retain any copies of your input or output.
