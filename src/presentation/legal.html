  description: Legal Terms, AI Ethics, and Neural Cache Protocol v21.1.
  
  ABSTRACT:
  A comprehensive legal and ethical framework for the Z-Realism ecosystem. 
  It defines software ownership, AI usage restrictions, and data privacy 
  protocols for the doctoral research in Informatics Engineering.
  
  ARCHITECTURAL ROLE (Presentation Layer):
  Acts as the primary compliance documentation. It provides the legal 
  scaffolding for the responsible use of neural generative technologies.

                    By accessing or utilizing the Z-Realism Research Laboratories, you explicitly 
                    agree to operate within the ethical, legal, and academic boundaries defined 
                    in this document. Z-Realism is a research-oriented platform developed in the 
                    context of doctoral-level investigation into neural generative systems.

                    The purpose of this framework is to establish clear responsibility, ensure 
                    compliance with applicable AI governance standards, and promote the 
                    responsible exploration of generative technologies in both academic and 
                    experimental contexts.

                This distinction reflects the dual nature of modern AI systems, where open

                generating, modifying, or distributing synthesized content.

            <h2 id="cookies">3. Neural Cache Protocol (Data Privacy)</h2>
            <p>
                Z-Realism is designed around the principle of local data sovereignty. All 
                inference workflows are executed within the user-controlled environment, 
                and no generated content is transmitted to external services or third-party 
                analytics platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internal <strong>Neural Cache</strong> mechanism operates strictly at the 
                infrastructure level and exists solely to ensure the stability and continuity 
                of long-running neural inference tasks.
            </p>
            <div class="info-card">

                    <strong>Session Manifolds:</strong> The platform utilizes essential session 
                    tokens (cookies) to associate the client interface with active 
                    <strong>Neural Task IDs</strong>. This is an engineering requirement that 
                    allows the system to safely reconnect to high-latency CUDA workloads in the 
                    event of a page refresh or transient network interruption. 
                    <strong>No personal data, behavioral analytics, or identifying metadata is 
                    collected, stored, or transmitted.</strong>
