  description: Legal Terms, AI Ethics, and Neural Cache Protocol v21.2.
  
  ABSTRACT:
  A comprehensive legal and ethical framework for the Z-Realism ecosystem. 
  It defines software ownership, AI usage restrictions, and data privacy 
  protocols for the doctoral research in Informatics Engineering.
  
  EXTENDED CONTEXT:
  This document formalizes the operational, ethical, and legal boundaries 
  governing the interaction between researchers and generative neural systems. 
  It serves as a compliance anchor aligned with contemporary AI governance 
  principles and responsible innovation frameworks.

  ARCHITECTURAL ROLE (Presentation Layer):
  Acts as the primary compliance documentation. It provides the legal 
  scaffolding for the responsible use of neural generative technologies.

                <p>
                    By accessing or utilizing the Z-Realism Research Laboratories, you explicitly 
                    agree to operate within the ethical, legal, and academic boundaries defined 
                    in this document. Z-Realism is a research-oriented platform developed in the 
                    context of doctoral-level investigation into neural generative systems.

                <p>
                    The purpose of this framework is to establish clear responsibility, ensure 
                    compliance with applicable AI governance standards, and promote the 
                    responsible exploration of generative technologies in both academic and 
                    experimental contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document should be interpreted not only as a legal safeguard but also 
                    as an ethical contract between the system architect and its users. It defines 
                    the acceptable perimeter of experimentation, the responsibilities attached 
                    to synthetic media generation, and the principles guiding reproducible 
                    scientific research within this ecosystem.

                While the surrounding software architecture is distributed under the MIT 
                License, the underlying neural model weights utilized by the inference engines 
                (including Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, and AnimateDiff) are governed by the

            <p>
                This distinction reflects the dual nature of modern AI systems, where open 
                software orchestration coexists with usage-constrained model artifacts. Users 
                are required to comply fully with the terms imposed by the RAIL-M license when

                Any violation of the RAIL-M terms constitutes a direct breach of the operational 
                agreement governing the use of this platform and may expose the user to civil or 
                criminal liability depending on the applicable jurisdiction.

            <!-- 3. NEURAL CACHE PROTOCOL -->
            <h2 id="cookies">3. Neural Cache Protocol (Data Privacy)</h2>
            <p>
                Z-Realism is designed around the principle of local data sovereignty. All 
                inference workflows are executed within the user-controlled environment, 
                and no generated content is transmitted to external services or third-party 
                analytics platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internal <strong>Neural Cache</strong> mechanism operates strictly at the 
                infrastructure level and exists solely to ensure the stability and continuity 
                of long-running neural inference tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                No telemetry, behavioral profiling, advertising identifiers, or third-party 
                tracking mechanisms are embedded within the system architecture. The platform 
                intentionally avoids analytics frameworks that would compromise research 
                independence or user privacy.
            </p>
            <div class="info-card">
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <strong>Session Manifolds:</strong> The platform utilizes essential session 
                    tokens (cookies) to associate the client interface with active 
                    <strong>Neural Task IDs</strong>. This is an engineering requirement that 
                    allows the system to safely reconnect to high-latency CUDA workloads in the 
                    event of a page refresh or transient network interruption. 
                    <strong>No personal data, behavioral analytics, or identifying metadata is 
                    collected, stored, or transmitted.</strong>
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- 4. ETHICAL AI PRINCIPLES -->
            <h2>4. Ethical AI Research Principles</h2>
            <p>
                The Z-Realism Institute adheres to principles of transparency, accountability, 
                proportionality, and harm mitigation in the deployment of generative AI systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                All experimental workflows are designed to preserve human dignity, avoid 
                discriminatory bias amplification, and prevent malicious downstream usage of 
                synthesized outputs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users are encouraged to critically evaluate generated outputs, acknowledge the 
                synthetic nature of produced media when publicly distributed, and avoid 
                contributing to misinformation ecosystems.
            </p>
